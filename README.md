### Evaluating a Pipeline to Distinguish between Wild and Hatchery Reared Salmon from Fish Scales

In our study, we explored a methodology to differentiate between hatchery and wild salmon using the unique patterns found in
their scales. The project began with an innovative approach to segment and label different regions of salmon scales through
image processing. By identifying the central coordinates and edges of each scale, we were able to draw transects across these
scales to measure variations in pixel intensities. These measurements were then converted into digital signals representing the
growth patterns of the fish scales. The processed signals served as input for a machine learning model designed to classify
the scales as either hatchery-derived or wild. Through this technique, we not only achieved varying levels of accuracy in
classification but also could draw comparisons related to transect lengths and their correlation with the salmonâ€™s origin and age.
This initial exploration lays the groundwork for refining the approach and enhancing the accuracy of distinguishing between
hatchery and wild salmon.
